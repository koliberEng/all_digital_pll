This entity all_digital_pll represents an all-digital phase-locked loop (PLL) system that synchronizes an output clock (clk_out) to a reference clock (ref_clk). Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

    NCO Instance: The Numerically Controlled Oscillator (NCO) generates an output clock (nco_clk) based on the input clock (clock). The frequency of nco_clk is controlled by the tune_ctrl signal.

    Phase Detector Instance: Compares the input clock (clock) with the NCO output clock (nco_clk) and generates a phase error signal (phase_err) indicating the phase difference between them.

    Loop Filter Instance: Processes the phase error signal (phase_err) and generates a control signal (tune_ctrl) to adjust the frequency of the NCO.

    Clock Enable Generation: Generates a clock enable signal (clock_en) based on the rising edges of the input clock (clock) and the NCO output clock (nco_clk). This signal is used to enable the clocked logic in the loop filter.

    Output Clock: The output clock (clk_out) is driven by the NCO output clock (nco_clk).

The PLL operates by continuously adjusting the frequency of the NCO (nco_clk) based on the phase error between the input clock (clock) and the reference clock (ref_clk). This allows clk_out to track ref_clk with high precision.

Additionally, the PLL includes a reset signal (reset) to initialize its internal state, and constants (CLOCK_FREQ, TARGET_FREQ, AW, BETA, ALPHA) to configure the PLL parameters such as clock frequencies and loop filter gains.
